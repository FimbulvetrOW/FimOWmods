  Planned features: 
  - Movement cost discounts for Forest/Hills for Ranger/Highlander (or Scouts? Pathfinder?)
  - Make Defender Tile count for most Tile-based Combat modifiers
  - Replace Hurry with Citizens by Hurry with Growth (more precision)
  - Steal Tech mission reward to be dependent on unknown Techs the target Player has (main - yields go directly to the techs, 
      not as basic science yield into what is being researched)
  - Better AI value calculations (I imagine this will increase CPU load)
  Maybe also:
  - Allow Growth Yield as up-front-cost for City Builds
  - Allow City Yields as Unit Upkeep (spread over Family Cities)
  - Allow City Yields as Unit action Cost (pay for Healing action with stored Growth yield)
  - some possibility to merge national Pagan Religion into your non-pagan State Religion
  - manual Bridge building, not automatically applied by an effect
  - UI mod: sort all Character lists better (idk how that list is even sorted now) 
       with Jobs(Council &gt; Governor &gt; General) &gt; 
	   no Jobs &gt; not Adult yet; in Court &gt; 
	   not in Court within those, 
	   and group by Family within those sections.
