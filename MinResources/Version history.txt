Version history
[0.5.1.1] Actually removed 0Harmony.dll from mod folder now;
          Updated code to mimic the changes in new game version 1.0.70671 (should have zero effect)
[0.5.1.0] New dependency: Harmony is no longer in this mod, 
          it now depends on the 0harmony mod.
[0.5.0.0] Latitude limits override: 1/4th of the map is always available for luxury resource placement (1/5 for non-luxuries),
          this affects Olives and Citrus on Arid Plateau and Cold Continent;
          If placement for a luxury cannot be placed on unaffiliated tiles, already placed city luxuries will be considered for removal,
          to be replaced by another luxury at the same distance to the city center.
[0.4.1.1] Update for game version 1.0.66959:
          disable new attempts to place at least 1 Resource at the earlier stages (starting sites, other City sites)
		  keep using only Tiles further away from any City site.
[0.4.1.0] Update for game version 1.0.66959
[0.4.0.1] fixed tiny bug with logging
[0.4] Update for game version 1.0.65497
[0.3] Bug fix to invokation of CanPlaceResource method: it was called with checkTileMaxDistance value of int.MinValue instead of int.MaxValue
      Added Overabundance mechanic: if resources were already placed  more than (2,5 * player count) times on the map, then other Resources
      will be attempted to be placed first. Because of the low probability of placement, this probably doesn't have a lot of effect,
      but it might still help a tiny bit to place more of the rarer and less of the more abundant Resources.
[0.2] Luxury Resources placement will now be attempted in rounds: 
      First round will try to place 1 item only for those Resources with currently 0 instances on the map, 
	  then begins the next round for those those with 1 on map, etc.
[0.1] Initial release
