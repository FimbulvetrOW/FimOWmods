  <description>Adds a civilian Ship Unit that unlocks before the Bireme
  
  Especially in Archipelago Maps, the ability to get across a narrow Ocean 
  can be critical. The new "Ferry" helps with this: it can Anchor and lets you 
  cross seas up to 5 tiles wide with a single anchored Unit.
  
  It unlocks for everyone at Labor Force.
  Trader Cities have access to it immediately.
  
  It's produced with Growth, can't attack and is really slow, 
  but it does get a lot faster when adopting the Exploration Law.
  
Unit: Ferry (Ship)
* 60 Growth Training Cost
* 70 Wood Resource Cost
* 2 Movement (+1 with Exploration)
* 3 Vision (+2 with Exploration)
* 0 extra Reveal Range  (+1 with Exploration)
* 2 Fatigue (+1 with Exploration)
* can Anchor: 2 Water Control Range
* can Harvest
* 3 Strength
* 2 Food, 2 Wood Upkeep
* No Upgrade, obsolete with Navigation (Bireme)
