  <displayName>More Food Consumption</displayName>
  <description>An attempt to make Food relevant, by adding Food consumption to Units and reducing some bonuses to Food Yields.

All starts get +100 food to offset initial demand a bit.

Population consumes 4 Food (and nothing else), no longer tied to Culture Level.

Lighthouse (Wonder): +100% for Nets in City, -5 Development Turns for Hamlet/Village in Nation
 (from +100% for Nets in Nation, -10 Development Turns for Hamlet/Village in Nation)
Hunters (Family): +25% to Nets (from +0%), +50% to Camps (from +100%)
Traders (Family): removed bonus to Nets (from +100%)
Pathfinder (Governor Trait): +50 to Nets and Camps (from +100%)
Vassalage (Law): -25% Unit Upkeep, no extra Upkeep outside Borders
 (from -50% Unit Upkeep, no extra Upkeep outside Borders)
