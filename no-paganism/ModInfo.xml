  <displayName>No Paganism</displayName>
  <description>Shrines don't found or spread Paganism
  
  Removes Religion Spread and Religion Opinion stats from all Shrines (and Acolytes),
  so that they can be built without having to worry about keeping one more Religion happy.
  
  By being unable to found Pagan Religions, Events that require them will be disabled.
  Divine Rule: Since Pagan religions won't exist, you can't adopt them as a State Religion.
